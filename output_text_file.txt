It
will
be
seen
that
this
mere
painstaking
burrower
and
grub
worm
of
a




poor
devil
of
a
Sub
Sub
appears
to
have
gone
through
the
long
Vaticans




and
street
stalls
of
the
earth

picking
up
whatever
random
allusions
to




whales
he
could
anyways
find
in
any
book
whatsoever

sacred
or




profane

Therefore
you
must
not

in
every
case
at
least

take
the




higgledy
piggledy
whale
statements

however
authentic

in
these




extracts

for
veritable
gospel
cetology

Far
from
it

As
touching
the




ancient
authors
generally

as
well
as
the
poets
here
appearing

these




extracts
are
solely
valuable
or
entertaining

as
affording
a
glancing




bird
s
eye
view
of
what
has
been
promiscuously
said

thought

fancied





and
sung
of
Leviathan

by
many
nations
and
generations

including
our




own
